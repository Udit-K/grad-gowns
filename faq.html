	<h2> FAQ</h2> 
<p> 
<strong>Q. How much notice is required before I book my graduation outfit?</strong><br>
A. Please book early to be sure of your order as we cannot always guarantee an order if you leave your booking later than 21 days before your Ceremony (being the date agreed for the Hire outfit to be available). Please check the website to see if the ceremony date option is still available or contact the Call Centre to establish if it is still open to book. <br><br>

<strong>Q. I'm not sure what degree I am on.</strong><br>
A. Unfortunately, we are unable to tell you what you have been studying for, please ask your course tutor or the university or college registry.<br><br>
<strong>Q. What does 'Height' mean? </strong><br>
A. Your height means the measurement from the top of your head to the ground. This can be in metres or feet and inches. <br><br>

<strong>Q. What does full outfit mean? </strong><br>
A. Full outfit means all the required items for the award that you are receiving and is usually a gown, hood and hat although this varies according to the institution.<br><br>

<strong>Q. Can I return my outfit to my nearest Diamond Ceremonies store?</strong><br>
A. No, please return all postal items as requested to the address as stated in the back of your gown. <br><br>

<strong>Q. Where do I collect my outfit from?</strong><br>
A. Your university or college has set aside a special area for you to collect your outfit and put it on. Details are normally given to you in your handout regarding ceremony arrangements. Confirm with your registry. <br><br>

<strong>Q. When can I collect my outfit?</strong><br>
A. Details of where and when will be supplied to you in due course by your university or college, however as a general rule Diamond Ceremonies will normally be available to robe you at least two hours before your ceremony. <br><br>

<strong>Q. How will I know how to wear the outfit?</strong><br>
A. We will help you put it on and ensure you are wearing it correctly. <br><br>

<strong>Q. What can I do if I am too late to order my outfit on-line?</strong><br>

A. You can see if your order has been placed by accessing the Review / Amend order screen which can be entered from the home page drop down menu. <br><br>

<strong>Q. I am unable to print my confirmation e-mail - can I collect my gown without it?</strong><br>
A. It is not imperative that you have the printed copy, but take a note of the number - which can be found on the Review / Amend order screen, as it does speed things up at the ceremony, in any event, our representatives will have detailed lists on the day of your ceremony. <br><br>

<strong>Q. When will my outfit arrive?</strong><br>
A. This will depend on the type of outfit you have ordered. The dispatch time will be stated on your shopping basket when placing your order on the internet. Please make a note of this. <br><br>
